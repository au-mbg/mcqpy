  According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, at what pH is a buffer most
  effective?
choices:
  - When pH equals $pK_a \pm 2$.
  - When pH equals $pK_a \pm 1$.
  - When pH is far from $pK_a$.
  - When pH equals exactly $pK_a$.
  - Buffers are equally effective at all pH values.

explanation: >
  A buffer is most effective within approximately one pH unit of its $pK_a$ value
  (i.e., $pK_a \pm 1$), where it has significant amounts of both the weak acid
  and its conjugate base to resist pH changes.
