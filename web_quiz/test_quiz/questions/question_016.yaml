  During the light reactions of photosynthesis, what is the primary role of
  photosystem II (PSII)?
choices:
  - To reduce NADP$^{+}$ to NADPH.
  - To synthesize ATP through chemiosmosis.
  - To oxidize water molecules and release oxygen.
  - To fix carbon dioxide into organic molecules.
  - To transport electrons directly to photosystem I.

explanation: >
  Photosystem II is responsible for the light-driven oxidation of water (photolysis),
  which produces oxygen gas, protons, and electrons. These electrons then enter
  the photosynthetic electron transport chain.
