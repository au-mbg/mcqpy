  Which of the following agents would most effectively denature a protein by
  disrupting hydrophobic interactions?
choices:
  - High concentrations of urea or guanidinium chloride.
  - Low pH (< 3).
  - High temperature (> 80°C).
  - Detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).
  - Oxidizing agents.

  Detergents like SDS are amphipathic molecules that disrupt hydrophobic interactions
  by inserting their hydrophobic tails into the protein core, effectively unfolding
  the protein. While urea and heat also denature proteins, detergents specifically
  target hydrophobic interactions.
