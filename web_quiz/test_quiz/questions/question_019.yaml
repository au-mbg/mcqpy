  At a pH equal to a protein's isoelectric point (pI), what is the net charge
  of the protein?
choices:
  - The protein has a net positive charge.
  - The protein has a net negative charge.
  - The protein has a net charge of zero.
  - The protein's charge cannot be determined without knowing its amino acid sequence.
  - The protein is fully denatured.

explanation: >
  The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which a protein has no net electrical
  charge, as the positive and negative charges on its ionizable groups are balanced.
