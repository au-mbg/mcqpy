  In competitive inhibition, how does the inhibitor affect the kinetic parameters
  of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction?
choices:
  - Both $K_M$ and $V_{max}$ increase.
  - $K_M$ increases while $V_{max}$ remains unchanged.
  - $K_M$ remains unchanged while $V_{max}$ decreases.
  - Both $K_M$ and $V_{max}$ decrease.

explanation: >
  Competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate for the active site, increasing
  the apparent $K_M$ (requiring more substrate to reach half-maximal velocity), but
  they do not affect $V_{max}$ because high substrate concentrations can overcome
  the inhibition.
