  Under standard biochemical conditions (pH 7, 25$^{\circ}$C, 1 mM Mg$^{2+}$), what is the
  approximate standard free energy change ($\Delta G^{\circ\prime}$) for ATP
  hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate?
choices:
  - $+30.5$ kJ/mol
  - $-30.5$ kJ/mol
  - $+7.3$ kJ/mol
  - $-7.3$ kJ/mol
  - $0$ kJ/mol

explanation: >
  The standard free energy change for ATP hydrolysis under biochemical standard
  conditions is approximately $-30.5$ kJ/mol, indicating that the reaction is
  highly exergonic and provides significant energy for cellular processes.
