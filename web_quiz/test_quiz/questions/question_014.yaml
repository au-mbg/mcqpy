  According to the van't Hoff equation, how does the equilibrium constant $K$
  change with temperature for an exothermic reaction?
choices:
  - $K$ increases with increasing temperature.
  - $K$ decreases with increasing temperature.
  - $K$ remains constant regardless of temperature.
  - $K$ first increases then decreases with temperature.
  - The relationship depends on the pressure.

explanation: >
  For an exothermic reaction ($\Delta H < 0$), the van't Hoff equation predicts
  that the equilibrium constant $K$ decreases with increasing temperature. This
  is because raising the temperature favors the endothermic direction (reverse
  reaction for exothermic processes).
