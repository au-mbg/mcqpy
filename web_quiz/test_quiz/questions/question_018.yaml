  Which factor would increase the melting temperature ($T_m$) of a DNA double helix?
choices:
  - Higher AT content compared to GC content.
  - Shorter DNA fragment length.
  - Higher GC content compared to AT content.
  - Lower salt concentration in the solution.
  - Lower pH of the solution.
  - Presence of denaturing agents like formamide.

explanation: >
  GC base pairs form three hydrogen bonds compared to two for AT pairs, making
  DNA with higher GC content more thermally stable and requiring higher temperatures
  to denature. Thus, higher GC content increases $T_m$.
