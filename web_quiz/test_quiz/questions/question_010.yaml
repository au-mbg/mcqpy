  For a first-order reaction, what is the relationship between the rate constant
  $k$ and the half-life $t_{1/2}$?
choices:
  - $t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{k}$
  - $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}$
  - $t_{1/2} = \frac{k}{\ln 2}$
  - $t_{1/2} = k \cdot \ln 2$
  - $t_{1/2} = 2k$

explanation: >
  For a first-order reaction, the half-life is independent of the initial
  concentration and is given by $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k} \approx \frac{0.693}{k}$.
