  Which statement best describes facilitated diffusion across a biological membrane?
choices:
  - It requires ATP hydrolysis to transport molecules against their concentration gradient.
  - It involves passive transport through protein channels or carriers along the concentration gradient.
  - It only transports ions, not larger molecules.
  - It creates a concentration gradient across the membrane.
  - It is independent of membrane proteins.

explanation: >
  Facilitated diffusion is a passive transport mechanism that uses membrane proteins
  (channels or carriers) to move molecules down their concentration gradient without
  requiring energy input from ATP.
