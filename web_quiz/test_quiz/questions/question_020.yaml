  What does a smaller dissociation constant ($K_d$) indicate about a ligand-protein
  interaction?
choices:
  - Weaker binding affinity between the ligand and protein.
  - Higher binding affinity between the ligand and protein.
  - Faster association rate of ligand binding.
  - Slower dissociation rate of ligand binding.
  - The ligand concentration at half-saturation.

explanation: >
  The dissociation constant $K_d$ is inversely related to binding affinity. A
  smaller $K_d$ indicates that less ligand is needed to achieve half-saturation
  of the protein, meaning the ligand binds more tightly (higher affinity).
