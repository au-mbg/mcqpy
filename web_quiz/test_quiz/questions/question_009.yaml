  According to the Beer-Lambert law, which factor does NOT directly affect the
  absorbance of a solution?
choices:
  - The concentration of the absorbing species.
  - The path length of the light through the solution.
  - The molar absorptivity (extinction coefficient).
  - The temperature of the solution.
  - The wavelength of light used.

  The Beer-Lambert law states that $A = \varepsilon c l$, where absorbance depends
  on the molar absorptivity ($\varepsilon$), concentration ($c$), and path length
  ($l$). Temperature is not a direct factor in this equation, though it may
  indirectly affect other parameters.
