  According to the Michaelis-Menten model, which of the following statements
  correctly describes the meaning of the parameter $K_M$?
choices:
  - It is the turnover number of the enzyme $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.
  - It equals the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of $V_{max}$.
  - It represents the rate constant for the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex.
  - It is always identical to the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex, with a 
    unit of concentration (e.g., M). This means something very complicated, which makes thiis 
    sentence very long and therefore it is less likely that you will choose it by mistake and 
    allows me to have an option that is spanning multiple lines.

explanation: >
  $K_M$ is defined as the substrate concentration at which the velocity equals
  half of the maximal rate $V_{max}$. It reflects both binding and catalytic
  steps but is not necessarily identical to the dissociation constant $K_d$.
