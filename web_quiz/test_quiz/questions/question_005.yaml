  Which statement correctly describes the relationship between Gibbs free energy
  change ($\Delta G$) and spontaneity of a reaction?
choices:
  - A reaction is spontaneous only when $\Delta G > 0$.
  - A reaction is spontaneous when $\Delta G < 0$.
  - A reaction is at equilibrium when $\Delta G < 0$.
  - A reaction is never spontaneous when $\Delta G = 0$.
  - The sign of $\Delta G$ is unrelated to spontaneity.

explanation: >
  A negative $\Delta G$ indicates that a reaction is thermodynamically favorable
  and will proceed spontaneously under the given conditions. When $\Delta G = 0$,
  the system is at equilibrium.
