  What type of interaction primarily stabilizes the $\alpha$-helix secondary
  structure in proteins?
choices:
  - Disulfide bonds between cysteine residues.
  - Hydrogen bonds between carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen of the backbone.
  - Ionic interactions between charged side chains.
  - Van der Waals forces between hydrophobic side chains.

explanation: >
  The $\alpha$-helix is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the C=O of residue
  $n$ and the N-H of residue $n+4$ along the polypeptide backbone. These regular
  hydrogen bonds give the helix its characteristic stability.
