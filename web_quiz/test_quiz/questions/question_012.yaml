  In a redox reaction, electrons spontaneously flow from:
choices:
  - A species with a more positive reduction potential to one with a more negative reduction potential.
  - A species with a more negative reduction potential to one with a more positive reduction potential.
  - The oxidizing agent to the reducing agent.
  - A species at higher pH to one at lower pH.

explanation: >
  Electrons spontaneously flow from species with more negative (less positive)
  reduction potentials to those with more positive reduction potentials. The
  species with the lower reduction potential acts as the electron donor (reducing agent).
