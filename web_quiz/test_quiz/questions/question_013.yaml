  What is the Hill coefficient ($n_H$) for a protein that exhibits perfect
  non-cooperative binding?
choices:
  - $n_H > 1$
  - $n_H = 1$
  - $n_H < 1$
  - $n_H = 0$
  - $n_H$ is undefined for non-cooperative binding.

explanation: >
  A Hill coefficient of exactly 1 indicates non-cooperative binding, where binding
  of one ligand does not affect the affinity for subsequent ligands. Values greater
  than 1 indicate positive cooperativity, and values less than 1 indicate negative
  cooperativity.
